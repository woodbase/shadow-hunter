## CoopManager — tracks co-op player count and provides difficulty scaling.
##
## Access via the global [code]CoopManager[/code] singleton.
## Set [member player_count] before loading a level to configure the session.
## Connect to [signal player_count_changed] to update UI when the count changes.
extends Node
class_name CoopManager

## Emitted whenever [member player_count] changes.
signal player_count_changed(new_count: int)

## Maximum supported players in a co-op session.
const MAX_PLAYERS: int = 4

## Active player count. Clamped to [1, MAX_PLAYERS] on assignment.
## 1 = single-player; 2–4 = co-op.

## Returns the enemy-count multiplier for the current player count.
