## HealthComponent — reusable composition-based health and damage handling.
##
## Attach as a child node to any entity that can receive damage.
## Connect to [signal damaged], [signal died], or [signal health_changed] to react to health events.

## Emitted when damage is successfully applied. Carries the damage amount.
signal damaged(amount: float)

## Emitted when current_health reaches zero.
signal died

## Emitted whenever current_health changes, useful for HUD binding.
