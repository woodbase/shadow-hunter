# Xeno Breach

**Fast, aggressive twin-stick sci-fi shooter — built in Godot 4.x with typed GDScript.**

Fight through breach-infested stations in high-octane combat designed for speed, clarity, and replayability.

## Core Architecture

- **Composition over inheritance** — HealthComponent, WeaponMount are reusable child nodes
- **Signal-driven communication** — systems never directly reference each other's internals
- **Data-driven** — WeaponData, EnemyData, WaveData Resources separate config from logic
- **No monolithic manager** — GameStateManager is the only autoload; everything else is local
- **Single Responsibility** — movement, combat, and health are separate classes

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full system design.

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in **Godot 4.2+**
2. Run the project (starts at `scenes/ui/main_menu.tscn`)
3. Start a run and survive five waves of enemies

## QA / Pre-merge

Follow `docs/pre_merge_checklist.md` for the quick smoke and telemetry checks before merging changes.

## Design Pillars

1. Immediate and responsive controls
2. High combat clarity
3. Scalable enemy systems
4. Modular architecture
5. Replayable wave-based structure
6. Designed for future co-op
7. Performance-conscious (PC first, mobile-ready)
