# Xeno Breach — Architecture Reference

## Guiding Principles

| Principle | How it is applied |
|---|---|
| Composition over inheritance | HealthComponent, BaseWeapon are child nodes, not base classes |
| Signal-driven communication | Systems emit signals; nothing holds direct cross-system references |
| Data-driven config | WeaponData, EnemyData, WaveData are `Resource` subclasses |
| Single Responsibility | Movement, combat, and health are separate GDScript classes |
| No circular dependencies | Dependency direction is always top-down (Level → Systems → Components) |

## Key Design Decisions

### HealthComponent (composition)

Any entity that can take damage owns a `HealthComponent` Node child.
Projectiles query `body.get_node_or_null("HealthComponent")` to apply damage.
This means zero type-checking of specific enemy or player classes.

```gdscript
# Projectile._on_body_entered — no player/enemy coupling
var health: HealthComponent = body.get_node_or_null("HealthComponent") as HealthComponent
if health != null:
    health.take_damage(damage)
```

### Damageable contract

`scripts/combat/damageable.gd` documents the expected interface.
Any node exposing `take_damage(amount: float)` participates.
The HealthComponent is the preferred implementation.

### Signal bus (decoupling)

| Emitter | Signal | Typical listener |
|---|---|---|
| HealthComponent | `died` | EnemyBase, PlayerController |
| HealthComponent | `health_changed` | HUD |
| PlayerController | `died` | TestLevel → GameStateManager |
| WaveSpawner | `wave_started` | TestLevel (logging / UI) |
| WaveSpawner | `all_waves_completed` | TestLevel → GameStateManager |
| GameStateManager | `state_changed` | Any system that cares about game state |

### No monolithic manager

`GameStateManager` is the only autoload.  
It holds exactly one piece of state (the enum) and one signal.  
All game-play logic lives in scene scripts that are loaded and freed with the scene.

### Data Resources

`WeaponData`, `EnemyData`, and `WaveData` extend Godot's `Resource`.  
They can be authored in the inspector, serialised to `.tres` files, and swapped at runtime
without touching script logic.

## Physics Layer Map

| Layer | Bitmask | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Player | 1 | Player CharacterBody2D |
| 2 — Enemies | 2 | Enemy CharacterBody2D |
| 3 — World | 4 | Static geometry |
| 4 — Player Projectiles | 8 | Projectile Area2D |
| 5 — Enemy Projectiles | 16 | EnemyProjectile Area2D |

Player projectile `collision_mask = 6` → hits enemies (2) + world (4).

## Extending the Architecture

### New enemy type
1. Duplicate `scenes/enemies/enemy_base.tscn`.
2. Override exported properties (speed, health, damage, ranges).
3. Optionally subclass `enemy_base.gd` for unique behaviour.

### New weapon
1. Duplicate `scenes/weapons/base_weapon.tscn`.
2. Create a new `WeaponData` resource and assign it to the scene.
3. Optionally subclass `base_weapon.gd` for spread, burst, or charge shots.

### Status effects
Extend `HealthComponent` with a modifiers array. Each modifier is a `Resource`
subclass that intercepts `take_damage` before applying it.

### Co-op
`PlayerController` is a self-contained `CharacterBody2D`. Instantiate multiple
player scenes; `WaveSpawner` accepts any `Node2D` as target — swap to a group or
nearest-target strategy without touching enemy logic.
